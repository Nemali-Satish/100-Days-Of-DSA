# 💻 C++ Fundamentals: Loops, Patterns, and Arrays

Welcome to my C++ learning repository! This project showcases my hands-on practice with the **core fundamentals of C++**, especially focusing on **loops**, **pattern problems**, and **basic array operations**. It is part of my preparation for placements and my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- ✅ Master loop constructs (`for`, `while`)
- ✅ Practice logic building through pattern problems
- ✅ Understand how arrays work and apply them to solve real-world problems
- ✅ Practice writing modular and clean code in C++
- ✅ Build a strong foundation in DSA starting from basics

## 🔍 Topics Covered

### 🔁 Looping & Pattern Problems

- Nested loops and conditionals
- Star patterns (pyramids, inverted, zigzag)
- Number and character pyramids
- Using indices and ranges for pattern symmetry

### 📊 Arrays

- Array input/output
- Sum, max, min operations
- Reversing array
- Counting even and odd elements
- Finding the second largest element

### 🧮 Functions

- Declaring and calling functions
- Return types, parameters, and scope

### 🧵 Strings
