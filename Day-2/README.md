# Satish Nemali - C++ Array and Frequency Problems

## Date: 2025-05-05

### Today's Learning and Implementation:

1. **Array Concepts and Problems in C++**:
   - Covered various array-related problems to enhance logic-building skills and problem-solving abilities.
   
   #### Problems Covered:
   1. **Rotate Array by k Positions**: 
      - Implemented array rotation to the right by `k` positions using `reverse()` method.
      
   2. **Find the Second Largest Element in an Array**: 
      - Developed a method to find the second-largest element without sorting the array.
      
   3. **Check if Array is Sorted**:
      - Implemented a simple check to determine whether an array is sorted in ascending order.
      
   4. **Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Array**: 
      - Created a method to remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place by adjusting the array size.
      
   5. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**:
      - Merged two sorted arrays into one sorted array using a three-pointer approach.
      
   6. **Move Zeros to End of the Array**:
      - Optimized the logic to move all zeros in the array to the end while preserving the order of non-zero elements.
      
   7. **Frequency of Elements in a Sorted Array**:
      - Implemented a solution to find the frequency of elements in a sorted array in one pass.
      
   8. **Count Pairs with Given Sum**:
      - Developed a method to count pairs with a given sum using brute force (two nested loops).

2. **Frequency of Elements in an Unsorted Array** (without using any libraries):
   - Worked on counting the frequency of elements in an unsorted array without using any additional libraries like `unordered_map`.
   - Introduced a basic approach with a `visited[]` array to mark counted elements and calculate frequencies efficiently.
